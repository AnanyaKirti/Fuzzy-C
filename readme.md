# Fuzzy - C means
This is a fuzzy-c means clustering algorithm.

# Usage
Run the fuzzy_c.py, and pass the name of the data set in as an argument.
The file should be formatted properly with a delimiter seperating the dimensions, and each point must be on one line.

#
The main file is "fuzzy_c.py" it is the basic implementation of the algorithm.
The fuzzy_c_iris.txt is an implementation of the algorithm on the iris data set (from UCI). and it's accuracy is being printed.
The fuzzy_c_animation is a simple graphic of how the clusters are being formed.
